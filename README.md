# simpleEnvelope
A simple personal finance program inspired by the Envelope Budgeting System that runs on the command line (retro Ncurses style.) 

## So, what is the Envelope Budgeting System?
Based on the classic "Envelope" budgeting system, each month's income is broken up into envelopes (or buckets.) Envelopes are named after the spending category they represent.
The previous month's unspent balance is rolled forward to each new month.  This encourages users to remember that money in hand (or checking account) may be already allocated to expenses/savings and shouldn't be spent.

## Why the retro crap?  Wouldn't modern tooling and frameworks be more sane options?
Yeah. I have to agree. However, I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn system programming with old-school C.
